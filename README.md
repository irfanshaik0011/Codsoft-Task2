# STUDENT GRADE CALCULATOR

********PROJECT OVERVIEW*******

1. *Input Gathering*: The program prompts the user to input marks for different subjects: Maths, Java, Python, DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms), and DM (Discrete Mathematics). It uses the Scanner class to read input from the console.

2. *Calculations*: It calculates the sum of the marks obtained in all subjects and then calculates the average of these marks.

3. *Grade Classification*: Based on the average calculated, the program determines the corresponding grade for the student using a series of if-else statements. The grade boundaries are set at intervals of 10 (e.g., 90-100 for A grade, 80-89 for B grade, and so on).

4. *Output*: Finally, the program displays the sum of marks obtained, the average marks, and the grade achieved by the student.

5. *Resource Management*: It closes the Scanner object to release system resources after use.

Overall, it's a simple yet effective grade calculator program that demonstrates basic input/output operations, arithmetic calculations, conditional statements, and resource management in Java.
